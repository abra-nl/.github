# Abra

Abra builds software and provides consultancy to make digital accessibility understandable for everyone.

We think it's very important that apps become more accessible. That is why we are a strong supporter of knowledge sharing. We are involved in various initiatives to make as much impact as possible. We started in the Netherlands, but are becoming more active in Europe and the rest of the world.

We are the founders of the [Appt Foundation](https://appt.nl), a non-profit organization with the goal of making apps accessible for everyone. We contribute with [open-source code](https://github.com/appt-org) and [public  knowledge sharing](https://appt.nl/kennisbank).
